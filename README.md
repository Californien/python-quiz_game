## Python Quiz Game

**To start the quiz, run `main.py` in the root directory.**

**âš  Be careful!**
> Make sure, you're using a compatible terminal, like VSCode (NOT PyCharm)

### Quiz in PyCharm

**If you want to run the quiz in PyCharm, don't run `main.py` in the root-dir. Instead go into the `_pycharm-compatibility` folder and run the `main.py` there**
*It's recommended to hold the backspace key for a few seconds in the terminal straight before you've been asked for an input in the pycharm terminal.*

**Command to generate `.venv` and `.idea` directory:**

```bash
python -m venv .venv; .\.venv\Scripts\activate; pip install -r requirements.txt; pycharm .
```

**`_pycharm-compatibility`** dir is not necessary. Just open a terminal in pycharm with alt + f12
